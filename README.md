## Competitive Advantages vs Traditional Insurance

| **Criteria** | **ClimInvest** | **Traditional Insurance** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Monthly cost** | 200-1,000 FCFA | 5,000-20,000 FCFA |
| **Payout delay** | 24-72h automatic | 3-6 months (expertise) |
| **Accessibility** | Mobile money + illiterate | Office + bank account |
| **Geographic coverage** | Remote areas via satellite | Urban centers only |
| **Prerequisites** | Basic phone | Smartphone + internet |

## Proven Technological Foundations

Satellite data is accessible via Digital Earth Africa, which provides historical images since 1984 covering the entire African continent. The NDVI system can detect crop stress up to **2 weeks before visual detection**, while Sentinel-1 offers **>95% accuracy for flood detection**.

AGRHYMET infrastructures guarantee access to real-time meteorological data for the 15 ECOWAS countries, with automated weather stations and Next Generation seasonal forecasting models.

## Sustainable Economic Model

- **80%** of premiums â†’ Compensation fund
- **15%** â†’ Technical costs (data, SMS, platform)
- **5%** â†’ Growth and reserves

**Break-even point**: 50,000 insured with a government reserve fund of 10% of premiums for major disasters.

## International Lessons

**Kenya (Kilimo Salama)**: Launched in 2009 with 200 farmers, the program reached 51,000 insured in Kenya and 14,000 in Rwanda. Premium revenues increased from 19 million KSh in 2011 to 33 million KSh in 6 months in 2012.

**India (PMFBY)**: The government program covers 194 million farmers with 50% premium subsidies. Premiums range from 1.5% to 5% of insured amounts depending on crops.

These successes demonstrate the viability of index insurance at scale with appropriate public support.

## Projected Impact

- **500,000 farmers** protected by 2027
- **2.5 million people** secured (families included)
- **45x faster compensation** (24-72h vs 3-6 months)
- **10x lower cost** than traditional insurance
- **Extended geographic coverage** thanks to OpenEPI data

## SDG Contribution

- **SDG 2**: Zero Hunger - Food security
- **SDG 1**: Rural poverty reduction
- **SDG 13**: Climate action - Shock resilience
- **SDG 10**: Reduced inequalities - Democratized access
